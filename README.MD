# SimChecklists - Interactive Checklists
This is a very simple app, to use as a checklist manager for flight simulators. 
I guess it can be applied to any checklists, like grocery shopping, but it wasn't developed for that, i made for my own flight sim checklists.

This software supports any flight simulator software, since it doesn't connect directly to the simulator. So you can use it for cross-check checklists with any flight simulator. The current version has checklists created specifically for: X-Plane 11, X-Plane 12, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (40th anniversary) and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, this software isn't affiliated with any flight simulator or any airplane maker.

## Disclaimer
None of the information or checklists in this application should be used for real-world flying. All the information here is for simulation purposes only!

## Usage
Select the desired checklist, click on a item to automatically cross it, mark as done and highlight the next item. 
If you're on a touchscreen (recommended) just touch the item to cross and move to the next.

## Checklist Files
Checklist files are simple .txt files, the format is also very simple, basically 1 item per line, with a few exceptions:
- the very first line of the file is the main title (aka aircraft name)
- each new sublist (Pre-Flight, Before Takeoff, Taxi, etc) is named between double dashes (ie. --Before Flight--) also on its own line.
- each item use the format descriptive=state (ie. Parking Brake=ON). 
- to add additional information or comment to a item, add a line right below it starting with double asterisk ``` ** ```
- If you want to credit the checklist, just use --Credits-- on the very last line of the checklist file.

### Checklist Masterfile 
Due to the requirements of the offline version, a masterlist, called masterlist.json must be updated each time a new list is added, the format follows:

```
{
    "file": "a320neo.txt",
    "name": "Airbus A320neo"
},
```

Pretty much self-explanatory, but the file property is the name of the file inside /lists and the name property is the display name for the list on the first screen of the app. You can also use the included masterlist_gen.py (unsupported) to auto generate the masterfile.

### Native Versions
Currently in alpha stage, Android only and unsupported.

### Requirements
The code is written in Vanilla Javascript, you need to use a browser with support for ECMAScript 2019.
No need to build anything, it runs straight from the webserver.

### Version History: 

Version 2.1 (2024/12/05)
- Added: Airbus A330 / Beluga checklist by tibonev.
- Restored the option of the user to upload their own checklists. Using fileAPI and sessionStorage, makes sure the file isn't stored anywhere permanent. (Fix issue #32)

Version 2.0.1 (2024/11/22)
- Fixed typo in README.MD

Version 2.0 (2024/11/22)
- Converted from PHP to pure VanillaJS, this is done in preparation for the native versions of the app to be able to run offline, since embedding a local PHP server would be an overkill, so the app will entirely locally in the native versions, without the need for the device to be connected to the internet, and this still allows me to use the same codebase for all the versions, but it will require re-compiling for each plataform on the release of an update to anything (code or lists);
- Added masterlist.json to concentrate information about the checklists.
- Created a script masterlist_gen.py to autogenerate the masterlist from the files in the /lists folder, requires python.
- Added support for a general config file, in the form of config.json, inside the inc folder.
- Removed option to select different themes (for now, at least).
- Removed option to upload your own list (for now, at least).
- Re-written the core code (old _class.checklist.php) in VanillaJS (checklist.js);
- Re-written the icon load functions in VanillaJS.
- Free native Android version release package - still in Alpha, no support for this version yet.
- Added support for comments in items. Comments aren't clickable, and to add them, just add a line starting with double asterisk in the checklist. - According to Issue #31.

- Renamed Airbus A320neo (Simplefied) checklist to Airbus A32x Family (Simplified) (checklist by tibonev.)

- Created a python script to update the masterlist.json file, simply run masterlist_gen.py in the lists directory and it will overwrite and output the masterlist.json file as required.

- Added tibonev logo by ChrisBunny (used with permission).
